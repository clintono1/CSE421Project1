			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

//Need to define a struct that will wake up the current thread, and refrence the queue of threads.
//Need to define a list or queue to hold threads in waiting.

//In thread:
int64_t sleepCount;
//Count ticks of sleeping threads

//In timer:
struct list sleepingList;
//List of the threads that are sleeping

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.
//In sleep:
-Check ticks > 0
-Disable interrupts
-Set sleepCount to how long thread will sleep for
-Add thread to sleepingList
-Block thread
-Enable interrupts

//In interrupt handler:
-Check the sleepCount of each element in sleepingList for elements where sleepCount <= the global ticks amount
  -Disable interrupts
  -For those that are, set sleepCount to 0, remove from sleepingList and unblock
-Loop this as long as there are applicable elements (speepCount <= global ticks)
-Enable interrupts


>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?
By ensuring sleepingList is in order, it keeps from having to search the entire list every time. 
Instead it can go in order to where it should be.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?
sleepingList is only modified when interrupts are disabled, to prevent issues in simultaneous calls to timer_sleep()


>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?
Interrupts are turned off when sleepCount is being modified

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?
This implementation is a slight adaptation of my original draft when looking at this project. 
Minor adjustments to functionality have been made to improve performance and readibility. 
For example sorting the sleepingList, to improve performance, rather than letting it go out of order. 
Originally, it hadn't been a concern, but question A3 reminded me that effeciency is a concern.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

//We need to Create a struct of type thread that has a list.
//we need to be able to control the priority "lock" and "unlock" members of the list
--thread.h--
	int eff_priority;
	struct lock * lock_to_acquire		
	struct list locks_waited_by_others;
//Need to sync elements,
--sync.h--
	struct list_elem thread_elem; //list elements for waited lock queue

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)


   P1     P2 P3     P4
    \ /   \     /
     \    /     \   /
      \ /       \ /    - P1 and P2 are waiting on L1
       L1        L2    - P2 and P3 are waiting on L2
       |         |   
       p5        p6    -L1 is held by p5, L2 by p6
        \        /
         \      /
          \    /
           \  /
            L3         - P5 and P6, waiting for L3
            |
            P7         - L3 is held by T7

Using a forest type mechanism, we plan to use eff_priority to track priority donation. 
Using whatever information is provided the data structure should produce the correct priority.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

We plan to do this by searching for the thread with the highest effective priority 
on wake up.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

In lock_acquire(), if a thread is waiting we check the priority vs the 
effective priority of the lock holder. Then we set the current thread to the higher priority, 
and recursively climb the tree. 

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

this method will remove the lock from the list of locks and 
force the list priority to be recalculated. Which should only
take max amount of the threads original priority.
Then the lock will be released.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

For our implementation we've discussed all the things to consider
when serring a thread's priority. We plan to check for any donated priorities, 
and checking the max or highest priority of the entire list. Also to be flexible 
enough to deal with recently added or danted priorities. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?
Sorting the list takes to much time, so it is best to just keep it unordered
and take the queue by priority. 

			  ADVANCED SCHEDULER
			  ==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

//in thread.c
#include "focus-point.h" //header file for fixedpoint math
int init_priority //initial priority before prirority donating
int priority;   // priority  of threads
int load_avg; //global variable, system's current load avg
int recent_cpu;
#define NICE_MAX 20;
#define NICE_MIN -20; 

//in thread.h
struct thread{
int ticks //
int priority	//priority of  thread
int recent_cpu //calculated recent_cpu need to use fixedpoint arithmetic
int nice;	//thread's current nice value min-20 max 20

32	20 8   4   58  59  58	B
36	20 12  4   58  58  58	B

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?

The scheduler is ambiguous as it doesn't state what should occur when the running 
thread is equal to another in queue. For our implementation we decided to not switch 
threads and wait for the running thread to finish before switching.

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

Most of the scheduling occurs in the interrupt context. 
With our implementation only the current running thread's priority needs to be updated, every 4 ticks.
The only time it is outside of the interrupt context is when selecting the next thread to run. This keeps the performance fast,
as a lot of time isn't used on the scheduler.
---- RATIONALE ----

>> C5: Briefly critique your design, pointing out advantages and
>> disadvantages in your design choices.  If you were to have extra
>> time to work on this part of the project, how might you choose to
>> refine or improve your design?

We debated on what we would do in the case of two equal priorities. 
Our current implementation can lead to starvation,
but settled on it due to simplicity. If we had extra time,
we would try and implement some form of aging, this could be done by adding a separate queue with the threads with equal priorities, and then assigning them priority based on time spent in the queue.
when two priorities are equal the thread gets switched to.

We implemented fixed-point math in the header file focus-point.h. Needed functions will be called when using fixedpoint numbers
Calculations will be done using the ones found in the pintos documentation (B.6). 
This was done to improve readability within thread code.
